###Answer
b, f and g

###Explanation:
Start pushing number in sequence from 0-9 and
as soon you got some number in list pop it.

###e.g. 
b. 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1

Assume var Arr = []; // empty at start

Operation | Arr | Output
--------- | --- | ------
push(0) | [0] | 
push(1) | [0,1] | 
push(2) | [0,1,2] | 
push(3) | [0,1,2,3] | 
push(4) | [0,1,2,3,4] | 
pop() | [0,1,2,3] | 4
push(5) | [0,1,2,3,5] | 4
push(6) | [0,1,2,3,5,6] | 4 
pop() | [0,1,2,3,5] | 4 6
push(7) | [0,1,2,3,5,7] | 4 6 
push(8) | [0,1,2,3,5,7,8] | 4 6 
pop() | [0,1,2,3,5,7] | 4 6 8
pop() | [0,1,2,3,5] | 4 6 8 7
pop() | [0,1,2,3] | 4 6 8 7 5
pop() | [0,1,2] | 4 6 8 7 5 3
pop() | [0,1] | 4 6 8 7 5 3 2
push(9) | [0,1,9] | 4 6 8 7 5 3 2
pop() | [0,1] | 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9
pop() | [0] | 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 1

*so sequence is wrong*
